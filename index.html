    <p id="web-security-answer"><ul>First of all, we need web security to protect the information on the world wide web from web security threats.</ul></p>
    <p><ul>Here are some web security threats you should look into and be aware of. Cross-site scripting otherwise known as XSS, SQL injection and Cross site request forgery also known as XSRF.</ul></p>
    <h3>Other important web security practices:</h3>
    <p><ul>- Make sure to always use "HTTPS" and "HSTS" on your website.</ul></p>
    <p><ul>- Sanitization of data</ul></p>
    <p><ul>- Secure authorization and authentication. A good advise is to have a secure authorization and authentication. By ensuring that authorization and authentication on your site is secure, it will be hard to crack.</ul></p>
    <p><ul>- Use of a well-known third-party application. You might have to do som research to find out if the application is secure and trusted. For example, you can check how many downloads the application gets per week or month to see if its a well known and trusted application.</ul></p>
    <p><ul>- Better password management. Avoid using the same password everywhere. You should have to use marks like "!?#" in the password to make it strong and more secure.</ul></p>
